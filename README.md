# Genetic_Algo_Spectrum
Genetic algorithm for fit of simulated spectra

This program simulates optical spectra based on x-ray koordinates and fits them to the experimental optical spectra. 
The fit parameters are the optical transition energies (site energies), that can not directly determined directly from experiments.
